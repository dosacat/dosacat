- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dosacat
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in  or SDE roles, analyst or customer success at growing startups.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to be a better programmer.


The power of software convinced me to quit my engineering job, and self-study computer science. It has been a steep learning curve to learn a vast new skill from scratch, but through discipline, I have thrived.
Why is this an important story to tell?
Because it portrays my tenacity to learn in an unstructured environment, which best portrays on-the-job learning.

Give me a take home project to see me shine!
